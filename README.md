# bedrock-bot
A Discord bot to help manage a Minecraft Bedrock server.

It checks the server status once every 5 minutes and posts if it's changed.
It can also start and stop the server using !start and !stop.
It creates a zip of the configured world in the configured backup directory each time the server stops.
